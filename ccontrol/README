This directory contains all the ccontrol project.

Cache Control allows an application to restrict any dynamic memory allocation to a partition
of the cache.

This tool works by loading custom code into the Linux kernel (using a module) that will
reserve memory and exports it to the user using virtual devices. The cache partitioning
is guarantied by page coloring (giving physical pages that fall in the same part of cache).

This tool does not work on fully associative caches.


Compiling:

The classical ./configure ; make ; make install should work
This project has no dependencies except for the linux kernel headers
necessary to compile the kernel module.

The kernel module install rule does not understand the install prefix,
but there is a special variable named INSTALL_MOD_PATH, so the following will
work:

INSTALL_MOD_PATH=prefix make install

Running:

You need to load the module into memory while specifying how much memory
the module should reserve for its usage.

	sudo module_load mem=<memory size to reserve (in B)>

Any memory you reserve for the module will be unavailable to the rest of the system (be careful
to not trigger the OOM killer by reserving too much memory). The module does not support swapping
allocated pages.

Unloading:
	sudo module_unload

How much memory can I get:
	As much as there is physical memory in your system.

New colored memory area are created by ioctls, the libccontrol provides a easier interface
to use the kernel module.

Using in applications:

	Use the libccontrol to allocate special colored memory area that will use the cache colors
	you specified.

NOTES:
	modinfo on the module will display the parameters and a small desc.
	The module dump some useful info to syslog. Type 'dmesg' to display it.
